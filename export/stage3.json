During this conflict that defined the climax of the Age of Plagues, the three daughters of Vistala, the Maiden Moon, and Irthenla, the Goddess of Love and Companionship, were struck down. Alraea, the Goddess of Hearing, supposedly felt for the people of the Vabarika of antiquity, and took the people unto her form and fell into a slumber. During this long sleep, Alraeas form was completely consumed, and the people she saved emerged from her final resting place in the Leucentran Valley. These people and their decendants are the Alri, who inherited Alraea’s gift for hearing.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Alri are a race of men, whose primary feature is their long, pointed ears. An Alri’s ear length and shape can vary heavily depending on genetics, nutrition, environment, and even spiritual attunement.</p><p>Most Alri have blond or brown hair, fair skin, and blue or green eyes.</p><h3>Phenotypes</h3><h4>Vanilese</h4><p>The Vanilese Alri inhabit the region immediately surrounding Minh Vanil. Their domain extends from the Delar mountains in the north to the Aredessuar River in the south, and from Point Jyanil in the west to Lake Ruulaternum in the east.</p><p>The ears of Vanilese Alri point almost straight up, ending in a sharp, pointed tip.</p><p>The Vanilese Alri hold the second shortest mean height of the major phenotypes.</p><h4>Riic</h4><p>By far the most populous group of Alri, the Riic Alri inhabit central Vabarika centered around the city of Ri and the Vabar River valley. The Riic poplation extends from lake Ruulaternum in the west to the Vabar Mountains in the East, and from the mountains of Laeth in the south to the Clantine Plain and Iridic Mountains in the north.</p><p>The ears of Riic Alri point outward on both sides, forming a roughly 60-80 degree angle with the head.</p><p>The mean height of Riic Alri is the second tallest of the main phenotypes.</p><h4>Northern</h4><p>The reclusive Northern Alri inhabit the north-easternmost regions of Vabarika west of the Vabar Mountains. The largest settlement of Northern Alri is Emeriet, a mid-sized town nestled between the Aecalan Mountains and the Trelegic Mountains. Their territory extends though the Vabar Mountains from the Iridic Mountains in the south to the Oelan Tundra and Freditian Mountains in the west and north.</p><p>The ears of the Northern Alri are of similar length to their Riic counterparts, except that they are pointed out and downwards, such that they form an angle of about 100 degrees to the head.</p><p>The Northern Alri are, on average, the shortest group of them all.</p><h4>Valran</h4><p>The Valran Alri are native to the region surrounding the city of Valra. Their domain spans the Alri lands in the north of Vabarika, from Point Jyanil in the west to the eastern edge of the Clantine Plain, and from the Delar Mountains in the south to the Brunumine River in the north.</p><p>The ears of the Valran Alri are similar to the ears of the Riic Alri, except that they point straight backwards.</p><p> Valran Alri are the tallest group of Alri on average.</p><h4>Laetheric</h4><p>The Laetheric Alri, while small in number, do make up a sizeable population in their region. They inhabit the Mountains of Laeth, primarily in the city of Laetheryn. Their small sliver of territory is bordered in the north by the Mountains of Laeth and to the south by the Simidian Valley.</p><p>Laetheric ears are widely considered the strangest of the bunch. They are shaped similarly to the ears of the Riic alri, but curve sharply up at the ends to form a somewhat crescent shape.</p><p>The average height for the Laetheric Alri is about the average height for all Alri in general.</p><h2>Racial Abilities</h2><h3>Auditory Prowess</h3><p>With their honed ears, the Alri can hear much better than your average human.</p><h3>Whispering Spirits</h3><p>On top of being able to hear really well, the Alri are also unique in that they can hear the voices and noises that spirits make.</p><p>Because all living things are made partially from spirits, Alri will align their ears with the orientation of the person they’re talking with to understand them better. For example, a Vanilese Alri will keep their head straight up if they’re interested in their conversational partner, while a Riic Alri would tilt their head, both aligning their ears to be parallel to the other person.</p><h2>Patron Gods</h2><p>The primary patron god of the Alri is Alraea, as it is she whose life was given to create the Alri.</p><p></p>","DataPointId":4,"DataPointTypeParameterId":1},{"DataPointValueId":198,"DataPointId":4,"DataPointTypeParameterId":34},{"Unit":{"Id":1,"Name":"Year","Summary":null,"AmountPerParent":1.0,"MeasurableId":1,"Measurable":null,"Symbol":"Years"},"UnitID":0,"UnitValue":200.0,"DataPointId":4,"DataPointTypeParameterId":46},null]},{"Id":42,"Name":"Amnuun","TypeId":5,"Parameters":[{"StringValue":"The Star Conductor","DataPointId":42,"DataPointTypeParameterId":3},{"DataPointValueId":41,"DataPointId":42,"DataPointTypeParameterId":8},null,{"DocumentValue":"","DataPointId":42,"DataPointTypeParameterId":4}]},{"Id":123,"Name":"Andel Matoreau","TypeId":2,"Parameters":[null,null,null,null,null,null]},{"Id":209,"Name":"Animalia","TypeId":12,"Parameters":[{"DataPointValueId":201,"DataPointId":209,"DataPointTypeParameterId":24},{"DocumentValue":"<p>Multicellular and heterotrophic organisms that do not have cell walls.

lowered the bar quite a bit.<br>While not quite as… eccentric as her brother, Enlynn’s preferences did tend more towards the applied and physical then the theoretical and mysteries of the universe. She began ‘exploring’ for ancient treasures and ruins of historical importance around the house at the young age of 13, and her parents swiftly introduced her to the archeological societies of Minh Vanil, hoping to channel her passion into something useful.<br>She earned the right to her first dig at the age of 19, and through some ingenious quick thinking, managed to prevent the complete collapse of a small pyramid, securing the relics inside for later study, as well as discovering a set of historical tablets dating back several thousand years.</p><p>Enylnn quickly gained some small level of fame for her discoveries, and while she didn’t much care for the social aspect, it did grant her extra funds and opportunities at other sites. As her travels took her further and further from Minh Vanil itself, she was forced to learn how to defend herself, wielding a specially crafted set of <em>Pick-Blades</em>, curved swords which double as pickaxes for climbing and excavation.</p><p>Her life changed dramatically when she was 22, with the news her brother Elm had disappeared. After weeks of searching and 0 leads, eventually Elm’s assistant Ifri, and a Detective named Dahlia managed to track his trail into the deepest depths of the Great Library of Minh Vanil, the Horn of Marouja. After they failed to return, she was chosen to lead a small expeditionary force into the mists, where her greatest nightmares would come to life.

His father and mother both worked as merchants, buying agricultural goods from the local farmers and selling them to merchants in the cities.</p><p>The Vavatini family had worked in the merchant trade for as long as records go back. As such, there was a considerable expectation on Vavatini (and his 5 siblings) to carry on and expand the family business. While working for his parents, Vavatini had a particular knack for knowing trade regulations and ensuring that the company would find no trouble with local regulatory bodies. His ability to find loopholes in the law, and always be on the side of the books, allowed the business to flourish. Vavatini exceeded his father's expectations in his ability to broker a deal. He loved that his son was following in his footsteps, and allow the family to continue and expand their business.</p><p>Ifri always had eyes for the horizon. He had heard many tales from traders, from the wide expansive oceans to the great trading cities of Preveza and Delvizzina. There were many goods out in the world to be traded, many of which may broaden the horizons of the locals. Where his father and mother saw useless, unattainable ventures, Ifri saw opportunity. Perhaps he could expand his family business across the island, or collaborate with foreign merchants? Or perhaps, he could journey out on his own, to no longer live under the regime of his family history... Whether it be adventuring, trading, or anything else, Ifri's heart was not in Stiinistasti.</p><p>One day, a strange Nordurejan traveler approached the Vavatini merchant's post, peddling various foreign artifacts, including river-instruments from Quaronnia. The traveler showcased the ability of the instruments in a nearby stream, and Ifri was immediately impressed. The inner workings of the instruments, the noises they made, the emotions they conveyed, the spiritual powers they harbored; Ifri was interested in it all. He and his brother, Kefki, saw the psychological use of the instruments in making business deals immediately. They purchased three and made their way back to the family home.</p><p>The boys brought the instrument to their father. He was reluctant to touch them, after hearing of their foreign origin. Kefki explained the potential use of the instruments in making business deals, and their father was having none of it. He chastised Kefki immediately for making such a poor financial decision and explained the ridiculousness of this idea. Ifri interjected, supporting his brother's points with his observations of clients. After a five-minute yelling match, Ifri accepted his father's judgment. However, his passion for expanding the business would evaporate. Within the year, he was packing up his bags for bigger ventures.</p><p>--- ::: Minh Vanil ::: ---</p><p>Having a lust for adventure and knowledge of the outside world, Ifri made headway for the city of Minh Vanil. Known widely as the knowledge capital of the northwest, Minh Vanil was the #1 destination for a young swomling interested in scholarship. Utilizing the connections he had made over the years through his mercantile ventures, he was able to find transportation, food, and shelter for his journey.</p><p>After weeks of traveling, Ifri finally arrived at Minh Vanil. Before him were buildings carved out of a pristine-white stone, towering above the glistening, emerald-green streets below. Every door he could see was arch-shaped, and displayed some kind of river-like pattern. It surpassed his expectations. Ifri was elated.</p><p>His elation soon passed, however, as he visited the Great Library of Minh Vanil. The building was gorgeous, of course, but useless to Ifri; he was not let inside. Every great building of knowledge that Ifri tried denied him. Moreover, every inn in the city center denied his patronage. Eyes glared at him, and Ifri was overwhelmed. He had gotten this far into the city through his charisma alone, and was having issues making his way around. He eventually retired to the outskirts of the city, where he found a shabby inn, was admitted, and collapsed.</p><p>He learned from the innkeeper the next day that Minh Vanil was quite unlike other cities. There was a huge culture of scholarship. A person's social status was determined by the academic works of their families, and more importantly, themselves. They could not stay in the city center on money alone. Ifri was stumped, but not deterred. After getting the information he needed from the innkeeper, Ifri gathered what knowledge he could from the populace, and knowledge repositories on the outskirts of the city. He researched the laws of Minh Vanil, doing his best with what little information he could. He researched the desired writing styles, the density of information, the subject matters; anything he could get his hands on. He was going to make it into the city. He was going to write his scholarly piece.</p><p>His first piece, On the Attitudes and Abilities of Those Near Scholarly Greatness, focused on the lifestyles of the people living on the outskirts of the city. Just getting this work peer-reviewed was strenuous for Vavatini, and he ultimately was unable to find someone from inside the city to read his work. Seemingly out of options, Ifri decided to run some experiments. He grabbed the one river-instrument he had taken with him and went to the river surrounding the city. Day in and day out, he would stare at and listen to the instrument, taking notes on everything he could understand. He would play it for people, making money through his performances. After four months of living in destitution, he finished his second work, Business, and The Water-Flutes of Lorimarou. Both confirming his past theories and spinning what was hopefully a new academic take, Ifri hoped heavily to enter the city.</p><p>After jumping from connection to connection from his days as a merchant, Ifri finally found someone connected with someone within the walls. He was able to score a meeting and presented his work. The work was approved by the initial viewers and moved up the chain. Finally, after even more months of processing, On the Attitudes and Abilities of Those Near Scholarly Greatness was outright denied. However, Business, and The Water-Flutes of Lorimarou was accepted by the Great Library of Minh Vanil, and he was granted a title within the city. Due to having no scholarly background in his family, and the volume of knowledge contained within the work, Vavatini was granted the title of \"Preon,\" the lowest intellectual title given by the city.</p><p>While his publication didn't get him much in terms of status, Ifri's work did catch the eye of an influential Alri within the city. Exalted Alvine Lady Tellumacil Umbemereluar, acting for her parents, hired the charismatic young swomling to act as a research assistant for her brother. The position of \"Research Aide\" under Lord Elmethethylon Umbemereluar had a reputation in the city. It was widely known that the past 17 holders of the position had quit within two weeks of starting. Vavatini, however, did not know this and accepted gleefully. With this new position, through the Umbemereluar name, Vavatini would now have access to the innermost sanctums of the city, enabling him to find all the knowledge he desired.</p><p>--- ::: Lord Elmethethylon Umbemereluar ::: ---</p><p>Tellumacil showed Vavatini around the estate for his new duties. It seemed that his new client had his own separate section within. Four stories tall, the glistening white tower seemed to shine even more gaudily than the surrounding town. Looking with trepidation, he entered. Upon coming through the front door Vavatini was already astounded. The four-story height of the complex was fully utilized with the front hall. A glistening, gold chandelier, way too big for the space it was filling, cast a golden glow on the already-golden furniture of the abode. A staircase with shining gold banisters extended to the second floor, where a balcony draped with red cloth stood gaudily. Red carpet with gold and green trim ran throughout the foyer, guiding the user to their destination within the house.</p><p>It was the loudest room Vavatini had seen in his entire life, but not the loudest he'd see today.</p><p>His guide took him down the hallway at the end of the foyer, turned a corner, and opened the second door on the right. This would be where Vavatini would be staying. It was an empty, subtle room. A bed rested in the far-right corner of the room, a window next to it. Opposite that was a desk, just the right height for Vavatini. The carved white walls seemed less offensively bright in this room, allowing Vavatini's eyes to rest.</p><p>\"Go ahead and set your stuff down, we'll be meeting my brother soon,\" mentioned Tellumacil. Ifri Ablidged, and exited his room with her.</p><p>The two made their way back to the foyer. They had almost made it to the staircase when they heard from above, \"EUEGHGHJRGNRJ.\"</p><p>Ifri's guide winced as if she knew what was coming.</p><p>\"TELLUMACIL. WHAT MONSTROSITY HAVE YOU TRACKED IN NOW?\"</p><p>Ifri peered up. Through the blinding light of the golden chandelier, he could barely make out a tall, thin figure. Standing on the fourth-floor balcony, the figure leered down. Even though Ifri could not see the person very clearly, he could feel the intensity of the gaze upon him.</p><p>\"Your new research assistant, Elm.\"</p><p>\"BY ALRAEA, TELLUMACIL. A CARDINAL SIN OF THE SIXTEENTH DEGREE! YOU KNOW BY THE CODES OF THE LAND, THOU SHALT REFER TO ME AS BY MY FULL TITLE!\"</p><p>Ifri noted this, as he had not read anything of this law in his studies.</p><p>Tellumacil sighed. \"Yes, Lord Elmethethylon Umbemereluar.\"</p><p>\"GOOD. NOW, EXPLAIN THIS RUG YOU'VE BROUGHT BEFORE ME.\"</p><p>As per Vanilese customs, Ifri waited for Tellumacil to introduce him, and acknowledge him to speak. \"This is your new research assistant,\" she said, gesturing to him. This was his queue.</p><p>\"Hello, Lord Elmethethylon Umbemereluar, second heir to the first heir of the Umbemereluar family title, entrepreneur of research. I am Preon Ifri Vavatini, once published under the Great Library of Minh Vanil. I seek the title of Research Aide, as well as all of the corresponding responsibilities.\"</p><p>This introduction was one Vavatini had rehearsed a good many times. He had familiarized himself with the methods of communication between those of different statuses. The young lord seemed impressed. Whether this was due to Vavatini's recitation of traditional greeting, or simply him getting Lord Elmethethylon's full name right, was unclear. \"Well Tellumacil,\" he stated, \"It seems the rug you've brought in has intelligence. I will properly introduce myself then.\"</p><p>With this, the young lord seemed to grow even taller. His figure, now rising significantly from the fourth-floor balcony, glimmered in the light of the chandelier. Within a second, Ifri realized what was going on. He scanned the room, frantically looking for something, anything. \"STOP, NOT AGAIN!\" Tellumacil barked. Ifri's eyes landed on a particularly soft-looking couch, which seemed to have cushions made from feathers. He grappled six of the large, soft, velvety objects and lunged to stack them under the flight path. In his haste, he fell on his face, and then looked up with a hopeful heart that he was successful. With a soft thud, the young Lord landed on the stack, face first.</p><p>Sprawled before Vavatini was a thin, stretching figure. Green, white, and gold cloth lay sprawled out over the landing sight. Dirty-blonde hair spread out across the cushions like a shining star. The young prince seemed to be wearing too much clothing for the weather and was sweating. Down on the Lord's feet were two red pairs of shoes, the bottoms of which seemed to extend about a foot.</p><p>\"By The Tears,\" Ifri thought. \"What a mess of a man.\"</p><p>...</p><p>One day, Elmethethylon was incredulously angry. He had just dropped his freshly-imported Daminere Brandy all over his, as he liked to put it, \"Glamour banner,\" which was thirty-three imported fine linin sheets sloppily strung together, each with a crudely painted likeness of the young Lord's face.</p><p>Vavatini had to do something. Panicking, he picked up a decorative lute from the hallway, hoping it would work similarly to the water-based instruments he studied so vigorously before. He ran his fingers across the strings, sighing with delight and relief as the strings let out an authentic twang. He tuned the instrument, already so familiar with the necessary sounds from his studies. He started to play a song his mother had sung to him as a child, or at least an approximation from memory.</p><p>He looked over. Elmethethylon had fallen asleep.</p><p>...</p><p>After years of wanting to go out and see the world, this was finally Ifri Vavatini's chance. He had finally convinced Lord Elmethethylon that researching river music would be beneficial to his prestige. It took a bit of fibbing, as well as convincing that the moist air of eastern Quaronnia would be good for his skin, but he eventually agreed.</p><p>Here, Ifri Vavatini was finally able to make some research publications, alongside the young Lord. He studied nearly every aspect of Moruu society, culture, religion, language, and law. He published on the topics of river-instruments, tonal magic, the flora of the Misty Vineforest, the harmonic sect, and the influence of the Moruu river gods. He even got to help steer a river ferry. Through all of this research, he rose through the ranks of knowledge, going from Preon to Twice-Preon, Thrice-Preon, Preic Phraetor, and finally, through his publications on the influence of stellar carp migrations on the flow of the livers of Lorimarou, the title of Twice-Preic Phraetor.</p><p>Later, back in Minh Vanil, Ifri studied the law of the city. He gained the title of Lawyer, making his full name Twice-Preic Phraetor Lawyer Ifri Vavatini</p><p>...</p><p>One day, Elmethethylon's oldest younger sister came to get Vavatini. Elmethethylon, as it seems, had gone missing overnight. Vavatini immediately got his stuff together and listed the places the young lord could possibly be. He then sent out search parties, each heading in different directions. It was imperative to him that they find the young prince. After weeks of searching, and nothing coming up, he enlisted the help of Detective Dahlia Découvrir, a Dolfaula detective with connections in the city. With her help, they tracked Elmethethylon's trail to the Great Library of Minh Vanil. It went deep down, into sections forbidden to enter by even the most astute scholars. At once, Vavatini set out to get permission to enter the lower reaches. With much bureaucracy, Elmethethylon's father was able to pull some strings and get the party into the lower library.</p><p>At one point, the party split up to search, and Vavatini and Découvrir were alone. Vavatini, worried about his friend, started talking to Découvrir. \"Something tells me this is going to be a huge hassle.\" What Vavatini meant, of course, is that he missed his friend. As the two walked, the corridors around them got progressively darker, eventually only broken by the light of the lantern. \"Can you believe this Dahlia? Mist, this far down? We must be near some kind of spring.\" These were the last words Ifri Vavatini would ever speak in the world in which he was born.</p>","DataPointId":120,"DataPointTypeParameterId":11},null,null,null,null]},{"Id":102,"Name":"Irthenla","TypeId":5,"Parameters":[{"StringValue":"Love and Companionship","DataPointId":102,"DataPointTypeParameterId":3},{"DataPointValueId":14,"DataPointId":102,"DataPointTypeParameterId":8},{"DataPointValueId":21,"DataPointId":102,"DataPointTypeParameterId":7},{"DocumentValue":"","DataPointId":102,"DataPointTypeParameterId":4}]},{"Id":116,"Name":"Istraea","TypeId":5,"Parameters":[{"StringValue":"The Olfactory Senses","DataPointId":116,"DataPointTypeParameterId":3},{"DataPointValueId":113,"DataPointId":116,"DataPointTypeParameterId":8},{"DataPointValueId":22,"DataPointId":116,"DataPointTypeParameterId":7},{"DocumentValue":"","DataPointId":116,"DataPointTypeParameterId":4}]},{"Id":5,"Name":"Istri","TypeId":1,"Parameters":[{"DocumentValue":"","DataPointId":5,"DataPointTypeParameterId":1},{"DataPointValueId":198,"DataPointId":5,"DataPointTypeParameterId":34},{"Unit":{"Id":1,"Name":"Year","Summary":null,"AmountPerParent":1.0,"MeasurableId":1,"Measurable":null,"Symbol":"Years"},"UnitID":0,"UnitValue":180.0,"DataPointId":5,"DataPointTypeParameterId":46},null]},{"Id":135,"Name":"Istrus","TypeId":7,"Parameters":[{"DocumentValue":"","DataPointId":135,"DataPointTypeParameterId":9},null]},{"Id":59,"Name":"Itealash","TypeId":5,"Parameters":[{"StringValue":"Air","DataPointId":59,"DataPointTypeParameterId":3},{"DataPointValueId":11,"DataPointId":59,"DataPointTypeParameterId":8},{"DataPointValueId":18,"DataPointId":59,"DataPointTypeParameterId":7},{"DocumentValue":"","DataPointId":59,"DataPointTypeParameterId":4}]},{"Id":79,"Name":"Jadterre","TypeId":5,"Parameters":[null,{"DataPointValueId":13,"DataPointId":79,"DataPointTypeParameterId":8},{"DataPointValueId":19,"DataPointId":79,"DataPointTypeParameterId":7},{"DocumentValue":"","DataPointId":79,"DataPointTypeParameterId":4}]},{"Id":200,"Name":"Jalicata","TypeId":23,"Parameters":[{"DocumentValue":"<p>Life forms based in the Satero-Nyaric element Jalic Cinetine.

The major players on the island at this time included the Republic of Nea, the Kingdom of Ri, the Kingdom of Myne, the Serene Constitutional Kingdom of Batanya, the Grand Sorsic Kingdom of Minh Vanil, The Tripartite Kingdom of Krepodynin, and many more. There were also multiple Quaronnian states controlling territory on the island, notably the Republic of Ocia, the Republic of the Vabbarician Isles, and the Republic of Eastern Demolla.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7xBKa4n.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"498px\"></p><h3>The Concord of Falybden</h3><p>After the dissolution of the Republic of Nea by the Kingdom of Quaronnia in conjunction with the Quaronnian merchants guild, leaders of the Lordatian and Alri states at the time came together to discuss a plan. After much deliberation, they drafted an alliance and carved it into the Stones of Falybden. Vabarika was to be divided into two states: An Alri kingdom in the north, led by the King of Ri, and a Lordatian republic in the south, spearheaded by the Republic of Preveza. </p><p>The council of the Republic of Preveza declared its claims on the precedence of control, citing the republic as a descendant of the Lordatian Kingdoms of old, which at certain points held Preveza as their capital.</p><p>The King of Ri, however, gained legitimacy through sacred Alraean rite and codified his claims by the magics of Vistala. He performed an ancient Alri ritual and gained the support of his followers. </p><p>These two states allied, absorbing the states around them through diplomacy, royal unions, and conquest. </p><h4>Expansion Under the Concord</h4><p>Particularly resistant to the expansion of the Riic kingdom was the Grand Sorsic Kingdom of Minh Vanil. This kingdom rejected the idea of Riic control, denouncing Riic law entirely. Many lords in the region swore loyalty to the King of Minh Vanil, and others were conquered and replaced.</p><p>In 2821, on political grounds, the Republic of Preveza seized the lands controlled by Ocia and the Republic of the Vabbarrician Isles on the island, beginning the First War of the Sandy Isles. Due to some economic issues occurring in Quaronnia at the time, with the help of its allies to the north, the republic was able to capture the lands. The war ended on the second Presida of Assesste, 2823, with the Treaty of Avail.</p><h4>Quaronnian Conquest</h4><p>Six years later, the Republic of the Vabbarrician Isles was dissolved, and the Duchy of the Vabbarrician Isles was reinstated. Three more years later, after Ugerra Fronti, the Duke of the Vabbarrician Isles, died, claims to the territory were passed to Acapit VI of house Underrum, King of Quaronnia. Two years after that, in 2831, Acapit VI invaded Lordatia to press his claims to the territory. This started the second War of the Sandy Isles, with more combatants than the first. Acapit passed away in 2833, leaving the war to his two sons. His firstborn, Acapit VII, would assume the Kingdom of Quaronnia, and his secondborn, Giata, would inherit the Lordatian claims. </p><p>Giata would continue the war, and with the backing of his brother, would come to own much of Lordatia. After ending the war in 2836, Giata I was proclaimed the first King of Lordatia. He would go on to conquer southern Lordatia, from the southern shores of the city of Peor to the border with the Serene Kingdom of Batanya. He would rule these lands until his death on the first Fairleda of Realianne, 2850. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the North, the Queen of Myne had passed away, all of her Alrian lands moving into the hands of the King of Ri, King Leisonaga Mysardri of House Mocunata. Now twice the size it once was, and holding the most fertile and prosperous lands on the island, the Kingdom of Ri was now a powerful player on the island. The King now looked to all sides for expansion. In the east lied the Vabar Mountains, beyond which were the lusterous forests, hills, and valleys of Chyplagia, unpeturbed by war for quite some time. To the north was the Brunumine river, a major source of meat production in the region. To the west lied three prosperous kingdoms, including perhaps the world capital of knowledge, Minh Vanil. To the south, the conquests of the new Kingdom of Lordatia left several duchies and kingdoms defenseless and without allies.</p><p>Leisonaga’s plan was to first solidify the Serene Constitutional Kingdom of Batanya as an ally or vassal. Having this state on the side of the Kingdom would be critical to putting a check on Lordatian power. Giata I of House Underrum knew this, and also vyed to gain favor in the region.</p><p>The current Queen of Batanya at the time was Serene Queen Traea of house Patrinth. She was 140, old for a Lordatian. She had many children, who themselves had many grandchildren, meaning that her titles would not be</p><p>leaving the family any time soon. Both the Lordatian Kingdom and Riic Kingdom proclaimed alliances with the Serene Kingdom, causing it incredible strain when the two states went about their respective wars.</p><p>By 2861, the Kingdom of Ri had assimilated almost the entirety of the Brunic river valley. With the sudden passing of Giata II in 2859, the Kingdom of Lordatia fell into the hands of Acapit VIII of Quaronnia, II of Lordatia. Parts of Vabarika and Quaronnia were united once again. Expansion on the mainland was blocked for Acapit, so he solicited the blessing of the Sylveque. In 2863, King Acapit VIII declared war on the Kingdom of Ri, citing heathenous rulership and sanctioned crusade. </p><p>This war, known as the Crusade of Ri, saw incredible decimation to the lands of central Vabarika. The war stretched on for years, expending the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and citizens alike. After hundreds of towns being razed, thousands of pastures burned, and hundreds of thousands of deaths, the fervor for war came to an anti-climactic halt in 2883 with the death of Acapit VIII. Quaronnia passed into the hands of his first son, Ridetri Umbrane IV, and Lordatia passed into the hands of his second son, Lan I. </p><p>At the young age of 17, Lan knew little about running the Kingdom, much less the war. Using the generals already present in the north, Lan was able to finish what his father had started, and finish conquering the northern lands. However, shortly after the conquest was complete, in 2884, the Kingdom of Quaronnia faced the Tragedy of Tremors, and subsequently, invasions from the south. Lan went to assist his brother with troops, when many major uprisings took place in Vabarika. The institutions of the Lordatian kingdom were torn down, and almost overnight, the kingdom dissolved. As a reaction to the tyrant rule of the Quaronnian kings, the Lordatian states returned to republicanism, with nations like the Republic of Bessia, Peori Republic, Republic of the Sandy Isles, and most notably, the Republic of Preveza, forming with democractic institutions in the vacuum of power. In the north, Alri kingdoms once again formed, continuing the ever-present quest for power. While, by title, Lan was the King of Lordatia, he would never again set foot on the island, and would never see it in his control again.</p><p>In 2899, Prince Rasil Underrum was born. At the young age of 14, with the death of his father Ridetri Umbrane IV, he ascended to the throne of Quarronia and quickly became a tyrant to be feared. By 2923, Rasil I had completed the conquest of the entirety of Quaronnia, completing the aims of generations of his ancestors. As his uncle, King Lan I of Lordatia, had passed away in 2914 without baring any offspring, Rasil I had inherited his claims to Vabarika. He looked to the island, once a large part of the Quaronnian Kingdom, desiring to once more set foot on it’s shores. </p><p>In 2926, a young, nameless band of thieves stole Underrum’s plans for the island, and delivered them into the hands of the Praphen of Preveza. After learning of these plans, the Praphen called the First Congress of Leucentra, where 15 Praphens, 2 Dukes, 13 Counts, 4 Thellasans, 2 Kings, the Orphyne, and even the Prorith met to discuss how to deal with the threat. After brief deliberation, the council decided to form the Bracanti Alliance, named after a trade alliance of the same name from 1200 years prior. This alliance of states along the coast was unprecedented in Vabarikan history, even seeing the likes of the Republic of Preveza and the Grand Sorsic Holy Kingdom of Minh Vanil on the same side. Rasil I inavded, and the First War of the Channel began. After years of fighting, the alliance repelled the Quaronnian Kingdom successfully. On the third Repoda of Assessste in the year 2933, the Treaty of Delvizzina was signed, and peace was established.</p><p>This peace would not last, however, as the Second War of the Channel started in 2939, as Rasil I invaded again. This time, he had new allies in the north-western kingdom of Jazira. The since-disbanded Bracanti Alliance stood no chance, and the Quaronnians were able to establish a foothold in the town of Valtoza. The Second The Kingdom of Vabarika</p><p>Congress of Leucentra was held, but failed. Hundreds of power-hungry nobles hijacked the meeting for personal gain, and no diplomacy was successful. Alliances were not established, and the Quaronnian armies began to gain ground in the south. </p><p>However, the Praphen of Preveza and the King of Minh Vanil knew that the top priority was expelling Underrum. Shortly after the second, the two men met and held the Third Congres of Leucentra. To help make a decision, they elected to leave the final say in their matters to an unbiased third party. This third party would be given the title “Phylave.” The first Phylave of Vabarika would be a half-Lordatian, half-Alri scholar from Leucentra named Trynea Rhozden. Solving the disputes betwen the Prevezan Praphen and the Vanilese King, Rhozden served a remarkable role as leader of a people at war. While not a King, Rhozden goes down in history as one of the Kingdom’s first great leaders.</p><p>After years of fighting, in the year 2943, the treaty of Thaeka was signed. This treaty served as an end to the second channel war, and saw no Quaronnian gains on the Vabarikan island. Underrum would pass away shortly after this war, leaving a succession crisis as all three of his sons had died in the war. Due to the weakening of the southern threat, and power vacuums left by the war, many Vabarikan states devolved into a state of war. The island fell into chaos, and many states rose and were destroyed. This period of chaos lasted 30 years, culminating in the Third War of the Channel when the newly-crowned Quaronnian King Cremouna Silan pressed his claims on the island. Two of his relatives ruled the Duchy of Eiporiki and the Kingdom of Avail, and were growing old in age. In 2973 of the 5th era, following the Third War of the Channel, Phylave Trynea Rhozden called the Fourth Congress of Leucentra to discuss the division of the land. Hundreds of duchies, counties, kingdoms, republics, thelassies, theocracies, and more were consolidated into 25 soverign bodies. Any independent rulers not invluded in this list of 25 were to swear fealty to one of the 25, or face dissolution. These 25 governments would, in the eyes of the Phylave, stand strong against invasion and disunity. </p><p>In the year 2975 of the 5th era of the 9th age, the 25 princes of Vabarika swore their loyalty to King Karamas Sarkay Trenice Tor the Great. This event transpired in an event known as the Fifth Congress of Leucentra, which had the 25 vassals relinquish significant soverignties to the newly-created Vabarikan Kingdom, primarily in the realm of foreign deplomacy. After the many trials and tribulations the island faced throughout its history, the King brought unity to the people that was much needed. Tor the Great was crowned the first King of Vabarika on the first Erasseda of Levadias, 2975. Under his reign the Kingdom has seen magnificant prosperity, as well as peace between all Vabarikans.</p><p>In the year 3015 of the fifth era, King Karamas Sarkay Trenice Tor the Great is now 103 years old. With the establishment of Vabarikan-owned guilds and businesses, the new protection of the new royal armies and navies, and the guiding hand of Vistala’s light, King Karamas I has shown all of his vassals a new age of richness and hope for the future.</p>","DataPointId":248,"DataPointTypeParameterId":18}]},{"Id":260,"Name":"Kishki","TypeId":19,"Parameters":[null,{"DocumentValue":"<p>The Kishki species is a collection of intelligent, cat-like subspecies primarily inhabiting the desert regions of the continent of Tabira.

Founded in the waning years of the second era, the city has seen many wars, travelers, and events, and has seen many things in the passage of time. The city is comprised of a large majority of Alri individuals, with pockets of Lordatians, Brevans, and other groups in small quantity.</p><p>Culturally, citizens of the city take tremendous pride in their history and heritage. From the early years of the city's founding, individuals of Vanilese descent have always placed high value in knowledge and wisdom. A great many scientific and magical discoveries have taken place in the city throughout history, and its historical scientific prowess fills Vanilese Alri with immense pride. Due to their high propensity to magic, Vanilese individuals consider themselves among the highest magic users in Sard. While their integration with the magical arts could be challenged by many unknown to the Vanilese, their integration of magic into their day-to-day lives stands above the average expected in the region.</p><p>The city is constructed almost entirely of Vanilic Marble, a shimmering white material that, when subjected to specific circumstances, turns a dark, yet still shimmering green. This marble, native only to the city's location, is unique in it's creation. While presumed to be a rare material formed from minerals up the Thyrr, Vanilese scholars eventually discovered that the material was actually the Horn of Marouja, a horn extending miles under the crust and into the mantle. As the city sits on and is comprised of the horn of a Sardenay god, the Vanilese take their city's founding with intense pride.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Pre-9th Age</h3><p>Before the arrival of the Alri, the Horn of Marouja has been host to a number of groups of varying levels of sentience. It served as a significant source of ritual power during the 6th Age. During the 7th Age, the Horn was a significant outpost and later settlement for the Kingdom of Northern Harpaea.</p><h3>Athanian Rule</h3><p>In the early years of the 9th Age, the location again served as a ritual location for the early Alri. Many tribes, villages, and farms existed throughout the region, subsisting on the land. Individuals from the local villages would take pilgrimages to the stone, and perform rituals on top of and around it. Imbued by the stone's heightened spiritual energies, the Alri would go back to their villages refreshed and rejuvenated, increasing their crop yields. The Horn was soon forgotten, however, as Athanian armies took hold of the region.</p><p>In the one thousand, two hundred and fifty-sixth year of the 2nd era of the 9th age, the Athanian Empire invaded the region. Seeing the locals as primitive, and under the command of particularly conservative general Reau Monterrei, the Athanian army in charge of conquering the region made feeble attempts to communicate peacefully with the locals. As negotiations quickly fell apart, war broke loose, and the Athanians drove the local Alri further into the island. For decades this trend would continue, the Athanians conquering new lands across Vabarika and driving local Alri populations into the Vabar mountains. While some Alri, like those in Batanya and Ri, faired better with the Athanians, many did not, and were expelled from their homelands.</p><p>Driven into the mountains, the newly-displaced Alri found themselves in completely different conditions from whence they came. With temperatures far lower, terrain more rugged, and soils different, the incoming Alri had many different environmental factors to adapt to. Lead by Chieftain Flaecil Zancliris, the fleeing Alri organized and quickly adapted, building farms and settlements nestled between the mountains. On |09|02|-|1258|01|17|, Zancliris and his company founded the city of Zancliri. Zancliri was not the first Vabarikan settlement to be built out of resentment of the Athanian Empire, but it was the first to grow to substantial size. For about 100 years, the Zancliri citizens saw peace and freedom. This, however, would eventually come to a close.</p><p>On |09|02|-|1352|06|21|, under the generalship of Ithann Venaille, a regiment of Athanian troops attacked the city. After 53 days of siege, the city fell, and an era of Athanian rule began.</p><h3>Founding</h3><p>While under Athanian rule, legends of the Horn of Marouja stayed with the people expelled from their homeland. In |1632|, the Cult of Vanil formed, and dreams of their homeland grew stronger and stronger. Slowly, the idea of the Horn of Marouja became less of a religious icon, and more of a symbol of birthright. The Horn would slowly become less and less sacred, and be seen more as a protective refuge against the Athanian Empire.</p><p>In the year |1741|, Vanilese thieves stole the Tormanic Hammer and the Stake of Irideus from the nearby Athanian mining settlement of Vaba-Herre. The tools were to be used in Vaba-Herre to assist in mining, as the province's underground resources are known for being diverse, many, and unique, meaning some were incredibly tough to mine with conventional means. Back in Zancliri, the tools were presented to the leader of the Cult of Vanil, and hidden away within the cult's temple complex. As the tools being stolen was reported to Athanian superiors, it was eventually theorizes that some person or organization in Zancliri was responsible. After the Zancliri city government was questioned, Athanian troops martialed the city, looking for the incredibly expensive and important tools. Throughout these events, the Cult of Vanil temple complex wouldn't budge, and while an increased Athanian military presence was forced upon the city, no-one got hurt, and the tools stayed with the cult.</p><p>For centuries the tools stayed under the watch of the Cult. The Vanilese dream spread, and many Alri not even from the area around the Horn grew into the cause. Bloodlines muddied over time, and the idea of a Vanilese state grew stronger. The idea of the Horn of Marouja being Vanilese birthright became standardly taught, at the distress of the Athanians.</p><p>In the year 2860, Macyl Vorynil gathered roughly 15,000 citizens under the banner of the Cult of Vanil, and left for the coast. The population of Zancliri was almost halved in this event, but the soon-to-be Vanilese were steadfast. On the way to the Horn of Marouja, many Vanilese lost their lives, either to the elements and wildlife, or to skirmishes with Athanian troops. On |2861|15|27|, Macyl Vorynil was killed by an Athanian scout, and was succeeded by Storyl Vorynil. The next morning, when taking helm of the group, Storyl Vorynil stated that, \"With Macyl's death, no longer lives the Cult of Vanil. Let it be declared that our people now ride under the banner of the Kingdom of Vanil!\" Almost a year later, on |2862|14|14|, King Storyl Vorynil officially founded the Kingdom of Minh Vanil, a city who's long standing culture is born from the fervor of the people, and the desire for knowledge of the late cult. On this date, he struck the Vanilic Marble of the Horn of Marouja with the Tormanic Hammer, and the Stake of Irideus, starting the construction of the city of Minh Vanil. With their own city in the works, and a hatred for the Athanian Empire, The Kingdom of Minh Vanil declared war on the Athanian Empire, becoming the first formal and significant state to do so in the region in thousands of years. Thus begins the First Athanian - Vanilese War, a war spanning multiple decades, and a huge blow to the Athanians. In |2899|00|13|, the Athanian Empire concedes defeat, and the Kingdom of Minh Vanil gains it's independence fully.</p><h2>Geography</h2><h3>Region</h3><p>Minh Vanil is a city sitting on the mouth of the Adilic River, a navigable river that extends deep into the hinterland. Located in the north western reaches of Vabarika, the coastal city is bordered to the west by the Henorja Sea.</p><h3>Climate</h3><p>Located in the north western reaches of Vabarika, the city experiences relatively cool temperatures to the rest of Tabira. The city, and much of the surrounding area, experiences an oceanic climate, with high amounts of rainfall year-round.</p><h3>Architecture</h3><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/h7wJEQi.png\" alt=\"The Great Library of Minh Vanil\" title=\"The Great Library of Minh Vanil\" width=\"192px\"></p><p><em>The Great Library of Minh Vanil, as seen from the western wing.</em></p><p>Due to the history and creation of the city, architecture is a huge part of the Vanilese culture. Early in the city's history, homes that weren't created out of sticks and wood were carved rudimentarily into the Vanilic Marble, forming primitive, cave-like structures. However, it is during these early years that the Vanilese tradition of combining architecture with script. Among the few structures that haven't been re-carved and repurposed sits the first Kingdom of Minh Vanil estate house, constructed by contemporaries of Vanilese king Storyl
